## 🎯 Project Overview

CUCU (Cooper Union Companion Unit) is a mobile application designed to address the growing mental health crisis among NYC high school students. Our solution combines cutting-edge NLP technology with engaging features to support student well-being.

### Key Features:

- 🤖 AI-powered virtual companion (CUCU)
- 📝 Mood-based journaling
- 🎨 Color-coded mood tracking
- 🧘‍♀️ Personalized mental health activities
- 🏆 Gamification elements for engagement
- 📊 Administrative dashboard for school staff

## 💡 Technology Stack

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
- React Native (planned for mobile development)

## 🚀 Impact

Our solution aims to tackle a critical issue:

- 38% of NYC high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless in 2021
- Only 1,101 out of 1,524 public schools had at least one social worker
- 80% of schools did not meet the recommended social-worker-to-student ratio

CUCU provides scalable, accessible mental health support to bridge this gap.
